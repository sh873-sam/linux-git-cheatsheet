- `mkdir` — make new directory
- `touch` — create an empty file
- `mv` — move or rename files
- `cp` — copy files or directories
- `chmod` — change file permissions





## Git Commands
- `git status` — show working tree status
- `git commit -m "message"` — record staged changes
- `git add` — stage changes for commit
- `git pull` — fetch and merge changes from the remote repository
- `git push` — upload local commits to a remote repository

- `git branch` — list, create, or delete branches
- `git log` — view commit history
- `git checkout <branch>` — switch to another branch












> Note: Git commands and file edits were practiced using GitHub Desktop and browser-based tools due to system restrictions preventing local Git CLI installation. Command usage and workflow understanding are demonstrated through branching, merging, and documented commands. Screenshots available as proof if needed.
